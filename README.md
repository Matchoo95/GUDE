# GUDE
Prototyping Coursework for "Getting Usability Into Development Environments (GUDE)".

# Coursework Outline
Introduction:<br />
You are asked to develop high fidelity prototypes for a system which will have three components. Two of these are user facing applications running one running on a PC the other on a mobile device, and the third is a server which will allow each application to communicate with each other, and potentially support social networking activities. You are ONLY ASKED TO DEVELOP PROTOTYPES FOR THE TWO APPS, not the server.<br />
You will need to:<br />
*Decide on your precise domain (i.e. the tasks where you will use the geocaching concept)
*Analyse the problem
*Produce a design of the UIs, and identify what information may be exchanged through the server
*Produce a low fidelity prototype of each UI
*Produce a high fidelity prototype of each UI (using software tools)

# Assessment Brief 
Current systems are usually now not stand alone applications, but applications that interact with others, over the network, and may have different versions for different platforms. This unit is about assessing the UI implications of that.. In particular, designing for these new technologies have thrown up a number of design challenges associated not only with the physical and functional limitations of these devices, but also with the effective implementation of new learning paradigms: life-long, informal, situated, collaborative, personalized, location-based and contextual learning.<br />
In recent years, a potential of location-and ubiquitous computing has attracted vast interests among academics and industries worldwide. Location-based services use Global Positioning System (GPS) data (and other mechanisms) to pinpoint geographical location. One interesting approach for location-based learning is geocaching. Geocaching is an outdoor treasure hunt activity in which the users use GPS to navigate and find a treasure, which is hidden in the ambient/environment (Fallahkhair, 2012). In addition, the notion of smart cities is gaining importance, enabling informal learning by connecting virtual and physical spaces in smart cities. The latest advancement of mobile, desktop and ubiquitous technologies enable tracking GPS effectively, which together with user generated content, web 2.0 and social networks could provide facilities to enhance citizen engagements and participations to learn informally by connecting from the physical environment to the digital environment.<br />
The assignment for GUDE is to undertake the user-centred design methodology to explore and develop a potential of desktop, mobile, location-based services, in another word cross platform technologies, to support informal learning (a broad category which includes marketing and tourism) in an outdoor setting using geocaching. Geocaching can support learners to learn about an outdoor setting, including domains such as science, languages, and cultural heritage. You can use the following related resources for analysis of requirements for development of geocaching applications, and also do further analysis in google scholar on the subject of geocaching to support learning and teaching. <br />

# The System
The system will consist of a mobile app, and a Windows app to support a geocaching community. The two apps will communicate through a hypothetical Internet server, so that data collected ‘on the scene’ can be imported into the Windows app. In this way the ‘affordances’ of a mobile device and those of a desktop device can be used to support different parts of the task. To aid you, we have provided 2 papers in the related field that you can read to understand geocaching principles and example of geocaching projects. You can choose a domain to support learners, i.e. learning about cultural heritage sitesgeocaching to support learning about Green Science, (including statues, and culturally important places), Language learning, and more, you can choose a domain of interest to you. <br />

This assessment focuses on design for usability, prototyping user interfaces, and about understanding the constraints imposed by devices and operating systems. You must use Visual Basic for the Windows application, for the mobile app we would like you to use one of the tools described in the unit for the mobile application. The mobile app should be demoable within the Webkit browsers, in particular Chrome, so all files should be implemented in HTML format. I expect that parts of the system (for example the communication with the hypothetical server) to be simulated.
